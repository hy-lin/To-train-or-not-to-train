- code: unique participant identifier
- task: task and assessment (suffix 0 = pretest, 1 = posttest)
- version: order of task administration; shouldn't be relevant here but I kept it just in case (A = forward order, B = backward order)
- trialNo: trial number (1-16)
- load: set size (3 or 5 memoranda)
- cue: retro cue presented or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)
- phase: updating or recall (participants had to recall the most recent values at the end of each trial)
- step: updating step (1-9)
- pos: position that'll be updated (1 to load from left to right)
- currentVal: current value for the to-be-updated memorandum
- operation: arithmetic operation to be applied (no sign means addition, negative sign means subtraction of the value in there; e.g., 1 means +1, -2 means -2)
- recall.pos: position of to be retrieved memorandum (order of events in file is the temporal order; e.g., in the first trial they needed to recall the memorandum on the right first, followed by the left one, and finally the middle one).
- startVal: original starting value at that position, in case the distance to the to-be-recalled one can be of any use
- correctAnswer: the correct answer that participants should have given at that point
- response: the answer participants did give
- points: accuracy of the answer participants gave (0 = wrong, 1 = correct)
- rt = reaction time
